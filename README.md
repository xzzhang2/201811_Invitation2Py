## *Invitation to Python: Programming for news, culture, and social justice*

This repository stores the slides and code examples for the workshop "Invitation to Python" at HKBU, 24 Nov 2018.

## About the workshop
This one-day workshop, offered by the Data and Media Communication Concentration, attempts to explore fundamental issues on the intersection of programming, data science, and data-driven journalism, and public expression. It will also make a whirlwind tour of Python. Topics include package installation, program execution, Python variables, expressions, data structures, functions, and fundamentals of control flow statements.
<p> By the end of the workshop, students will have a preliminary understanding of data science in the context of media and communication, and preparatory knowledge of Python. It aims to lay the foundation for advanced data and media communication courses, such as Data Analysis Studio, Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization, Data Media Projects, and the proposing interactive DMC news platform.
